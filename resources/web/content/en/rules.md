## Streaming your matches
In the same way as the SRL and Racetime races, live streaming your one-on-one
OoTR Ladder matches on any stream service is **mandatory**.  
If you don't have an account yet and you are planning to join your first OoTR
Ladder race, we invite you to create an account.

We strongly recommend to link your Twitch account to your Discord profile so
that your stream can be easily accessible for any live review if necessary.

## Before the beginning of your match
When receiving your seed, you'll have **15 minutes** to prepare your
stream setup.
We don't rely on a system where registered players have to declare themselves
ready in order to start the race. **The race begins at the exact time specified
in the session detail.** It is assumed that every player is aware of the
schedule for each race he/she registers for.

We ask you to be vigilant between the moment your stream goes live and the start of the race. Even if nobody has the knowledge of their opponent's identity, we do not exclude the fact that some malevolent participants may try to find out this data by themselves by comparing the “Seed Hash” your OoTR ROM has with their own.
*As it stand, there's no technical way from the ROM itself to hide this hash.*
That's why we count on you to be extra vigilant.
Here are a few things you can do to protect yourself:

- Add an overlay in order to hide the seed hash in the file selection screen. Don't forget to disable this overlay when the race starts.
- Stay on the title screen of the game until the beginning of the race.

These measures are taken in order to avoid *as much as possible* any risk of
cheating through the viewing of your stream by your opponent.

## During your match
During your match, we expect all participants to follow the rules stated below.

OoTR Ladder races are following the same basic rules as ZSR races. However,
with the beta test we've had so far, we would like to highlight a few points on
which we will be very careful:

- Respect for one's opponent is as obvious as it is indispensable. We will be
  uncompromising in the event of any disrespect for your opponent or the
  players in the race.
- Any extra help or spoilers by your Twitch chat regarding your opponent's
  identity and the seed you're playing is **strictly forbidden**. You are
  responsible for your community.
- **We don't want to see players in voice chat** (Discord, TeamSpeak or any
  other similar service) with other people, whether they're in the same session
  as you or not. We've already seen some cases of “meta-gaming” from
  beta-testers because of the fact people in voice chat decided to mute
  themselves. That's something we don't want to see happen again.

## Generally speaking
We ask you to keep your Twitch VoDs accessible. If you are locking them so that
only your subscribers can have access, it is imperative to provide an
alternative way to view your past races.

Any `!done` or `!forfeit` is definitive as you will receive both the *spoiler
log* for your seed and your opponent name.

To win you need to complete your race, even if your opponent forfeited.
